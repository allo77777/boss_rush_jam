#it seems overwhelmig but it's pretty simple.
#this script is meant to switch in between the different states.
#as for the other nodes and scripts, you'll implement the logic there.
#for example, for the running script, you could say, if input.is_action_pressed(right):
#														velocity.x = speed * wathever
#													if velocity.x == 0:
#														switch to idle state etc.
